Facts about the data:

1. Each row has 3 datapoints: Timestamp, Price, Units Traded
2. Timestamp is in format YYYYMMDD:HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS (seconds as float to capture microsecond)
3. Price is float
4. Units Traded is integer
5. Price and Units can be zero or negative
6. Timestamps:  -can be duplicate
				-not in order
				-difference between two consecutive timestamps can be as large as possible
7. Data is a stream of network data packets

Facts about network latency:

1. Network latency is in milliseconds
2. Latency should not exceed more than 2-3 seconds considering the packet travels the largest distance

Check points:

1. All three items in a row should be in right format
2. The Price and Units Traded should not be zero or negative and should be within 2 standard deviations from mean
3. Rows with duplicate timestamps should be removed as those are unreliable and we have no mechanism to check which one is real data
4. Two consecutive rows should have timestamps within 3 seconds range
